            <p>We provide front-end challenges that include professional web designs. These allow you to practice
              building websites in a realistic workflow. Taking these challenges will help you improve your skills, gain
              experience creating websites, and build up an incredible project portfolio. We also have a large community
              of developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!</p>

            Is Frontend Mentor free?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some that are premium and require a Pro
              subscription to access. It will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so it's easy to
              tell the difference.</p>

            <p>Definitely! Please do feel free to use whatever you build in your portfolio. Helping developers add
              professional-looking projects to their portfolio was one of the reasons we created this platform!</p>

            <p>The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our Discord server. There are thousands of
              other developers in there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a dedicated "help"
              channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get an invite to our Discord server here.</p>
